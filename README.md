LinkedList01.Java
This project demonstrates the implementation of various functions related to Linked Lists in Java. It includes a comprehensive approach to solving common problems and understanding the working of linked list data structures.

Features
Creation of singly and doubly linked lists
Basic operations such as:
Insertion (at beginning, end, and middle)
Deletion (from beginning, end, and specific position)
Searching for elements
Reversing a linked list
Sorting linked list elements

Problem-Solving Approach
In this project, several problems were solved using linked lists, demonstrating their practical application in real-world scenarios. The solutions are optimized for both time and space complexity, making the project a valuable reference for understanding linked list-based problems.
